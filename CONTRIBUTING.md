# Contributing to Merlin/Maven

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing how we can better the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We
actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed something important, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test passes
5. Your pull request should go to the branch `master
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base
    R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- You can use the extension prettier with the default setting
- All the imports should be in-line and a pyramide
- For commits we now implement
  [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
